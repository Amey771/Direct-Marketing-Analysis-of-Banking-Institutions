# Data Mining Final Project Report

## Executive Summary

This project focuses on a classification task for a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaign. By predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, multiple classification models were evaluated. **Logistic Regression** achieved the best performance with a 91% accuracy, indicating a strong linear boundary in the dataset.

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the Data Mining course. The objective is to develop a robust predictive model to assess the success of marketing campaigns by analyzing both customer demographics and socio-economic factors. The project covers comprehensive steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

---

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict the success of direct marketing campaigns executed via phone calls by a Portuguese banking institution. Specifically, the task is to determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit ('y') based on a wide array of input features such as demographics, economic indicators, and campaign-related variables.

---

## Dataset

The primary dataset used is **"bank-additional-full.csv"**, which includes:
- **41,188 examples** with 20 input variables.
- **Input variables** include: age, job type, marital status, education, default status, housing loan, personal loan, contact details, campaign information, and various economic indicators.
- **Target variable:** `y` (indicating whether the client subscribed to a term deposit).

---

## Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps include:
- **Column Renaming:** Standardizing column names by replacing periods with underscores.
- **Missing Value Handling:** Imputing missing values using the median for numerical features and the mode for categorical features.
- **Feature Selection:** Removing highly correlated numerical features to reduce multicollinearity.
- **Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations using OneHotEncoder and LabelEncoder.
- **Data Splitting:** Partitioning the data into training, validation, and test sets.

---

## Data Organization

Data was organized into distinct processing pipelines:
- **Numerical Pipeline:** Handling imputation and scaling.
- **Categorical Pipeline:** Applying one-hot encoding and label encoding.
This structured approach ensured clarity during data manipulation and set a strong foundation for model training.

## Results

Several classifiers were implemented and compared:
- **KMeans:** 89% accuracy  
- **KNearest Neighbors:** 90% accuracy  
- **Random Forest:** 89% accuracy  
- **Decision Tree:** 83% accuracy  
- **Logistic Regression:** **91% accuracy**  
- **Naive Bayes:** 81% accuracy  
- **Support Vector Classifier:** 88% accuracy  
- **Gradient Boosting:** 88% accuracy  

The evaluation was based on confusion matrices, precision, recall, and f1-scores. Logistic Regression emerged as the top performer.

## Classifier Performance

The performance metrics indicate:
- **Logistic Regression** provided the best overall performance with the highest accuracy and superior f1-scores for both classes.
- Each model was analyzed using a confusion matrix to assess the balance between true positives and true negatives, with special focus on the modelâ€™s ability to predict the positive class.

---

## Conclusion

The analysis confirms that Logistic Regression is the most effective classifier for this dataset, achieving a 91% accuracy rate. The preprocessing strategies and evaluation methods played a critical role in optimizing model performance, demonstrating the importance of thorough data preparation in predictive modeling.

## Future Work

Potential future directions include:
- Enhancing visualization techniques for high-dimensional data.
- Implementing more sophisticated grid searches and advanced feature engineering methods.
- Addressing class imbalance using oversampling techniques.
- Utilizing high-performance computing (e.g., GPU acceleration) to speed up model training, especially for computationally intensive models like SVC.
